## Key Features

* Responsive dashboard and listing pages
* Create / edit / delete items (shipments, events or community posts)
* Item detail views with status and history timeline
* Search and filter capability (by id, status, or date)
* Client-focused UX: clear CTA, simple forms, confirmation dialogs
* Ready for integration with a backend API (examples included below)

## Tech Stack

Primary technologies assumed for this demo (adjust if your repo differs):

* Frontend : React or Next.js (TypeScript recommended)
* Styling : Tailwind CSS (or plain CSS with utility classes)
* State management : Redux Toolkit or React Context
* HTTP client : Axios or fetch
* Forms : React Hook Form or controlled components
* Icons / UI : Heroicons / Font Awesome / custom SVGs
* Deployment : Vercel

## Design & UX Notes

* Focus on minimal onboarding friction and clear CTAs.
* Use large tappable areas for mobile and keep forms short.
* Use subtle motion for state changes (status update, success toast).
* Keep colors high-contrast for readability and accessibility.
